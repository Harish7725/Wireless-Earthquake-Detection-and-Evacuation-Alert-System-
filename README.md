"Wireless Earthquake Detection and Evacuation Alert System"

Project Overview:
     *Uses sensors to detect seismic activity, transmitting data wirelessly to a central hub. 
     *Upon detection, the system triggers alarms, alerts authorities via SMS/GSM, and activates evacuation routes, ensuring timely evacuation and minimizing casualties.
   
     
Benefits:

   1. Timely Evacuation: Enables people to evacuate quickly, reducing the risk of injury or death.
   2. Reduced Damage: Alerts authorities to take necessary measures to minimize damage to infrastructure.
   3. Improved Emergency Response: Automated alerts ensure that emergency services respond promptly.

Future Enhancements:

   1. Integration with Existing Systems: Integrate with existing emergency response systems.
   2. Machine Learning Algorithms: Implement machine learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy.
   3. Mobile App: Develop a mobile app to receive alerts and provide criticalÂ information.
